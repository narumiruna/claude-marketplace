# Slide-Creator Skill Improvements

**Analysis Date**: 2026-01-09
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-09
**Evaluated Against**: Skill-creator best practices
**Current Status**: Phase 3 remains optional
**Overall Grade**: Strong (A-) - High-impact enhancements implemented

---

## Executive Summary

Remaining opportunities are Phase 3 polish items (optional validation runs).

---

## Current Strengths ✅

### 1. Excellent Progressive Disclosure
- SKILL.md: 182 lines (well under 500-line recommendation)
- Clear three-module structure with ordered reading lists
- 14 reference files totaling ~6,138 lines
- Core rules establish unified design principles upfront

### 2. Strong Reference Organization
- All reference files include table of contents
- Clear "See Also" cross-references
- Well-organized by module (color-design/, marpit-authoring/, svg-illustration/)
- Appropriate file sizes (200-600 lines each)

### 3. Comprehensive Frontmatter
- Description includes both capabilities AND trigger contexts
- Lists all major use cases (critical for skill triggering)
- Clear, searchable keywords

### 4. Practical Content
- Concrete examples with code snippets
- Decision guides and workflows
- Output format templates
- Validation checklists

## Priority 3: Polish & Enhancement (Optional)

### Final validation

- [ ] Run `scripts/validate_svg.py` on all SVG assets
- [ ] Run `scripts/validate_marpit.sh` on all template .md files
- [ ] Check all internal links work
- [ ] Test scripts with sample inputs
- [ ] Verify templates render correctly in Marp

---

## Future Enhancements (Beyond Current Scope)

### Advanced Scripts

- `scripts/optimize_svg.py` - Minimize SVG file size
- `scripts/extract_palette.py` - Extract colors from image
- `scripts/batch_validate.sh` - Validate entire presentation directory
- `scripts/export_pdf.sh` - Marp CLI wrapper for PDF export

### Additional Assets

- `assets/templates/academic.md` - Research presentation template
- `assets/templates/startup-pitch.md` - Investor pitch template
- `assets/backgrounds/` - Subtle background patterns (SVG)
- `assets/animations/` - Simple CSS animations for slides

### Integration

- Pre-commit hook for automatic SVG validation
- GitHub Actions workflow for presentation CI/CD
- VS Code snippet file for common Marpit patterns
- Marp theme file (CSS) for custom slide-creator theme

## Questions for User

Before implementing these improvements, consider:

1. **Template preferences**: Are there specific presentation types/audiences we should prioritize?
2. **Script features**: Which validation/automation tasks are most painful currently?
3. **Asset formats**: Any specific icon sets or diagram types commonly needed?
4. **Integration**: Would pre-commit hooks or CI/CD be valuable?
5. **Branding**: Should templates include placeholder for logo/brand assets?

## Conclusion

The slide-creator skill is **well-designed and production-ready** with excellent progressive disclosure.

**Recommended implementation order**: Optional final validation

**Estimated effort**:
- Phase 3: 1-2 hours (validation)

**ROI**: Medium - optional polish for smoother onboarding and troubleshooting.
