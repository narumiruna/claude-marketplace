```

## 14. Code Example with Context

````markdown
# Implementation

**Approach:**
Use async/await for better performance

```python
async def fetch_data(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            return await response.json()
```

**Result:** 3x faster response time

## 15. Two-Column Concept

```markdown
# Comparison

**Option A**                    | **Option B**
- Characteristic 1               | - Characteristic 1
- Characteristic 2               | - Characteristic 2
- Trade-off                      | - Trade-off
```

Note: True two-column layout depends on theme support. This uses table syntax as fallback.
